title:  "Adding Landline to Your Site"
---

Let's build a simple application that uses Landline to let its users chat. We'll use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), as many developers are familiar with the framework. More examples will be coming soon!

Let's initialize a new app in your projects directory

```
$ rails new my-landline
$ cd my-landline
```

We need users, so let's install and configure [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
