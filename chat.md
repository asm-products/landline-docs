### Mentions

Landline supports **@user** mentions, which will be parsed as a link to the mentioned user's `profile_url`.

You can also reference a *#room*, which will turn into a link to that chat room for your team.

### Emoji

Landline uses [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) client-side for all of your expressive messaging needs.

Check out [emoji.codes](http://emoji.codes/) for shortcuts, and feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/asm-products/landline-web/pulls) for better shortcut support in Landline.

### Formatting

Landline supports a limited subset of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)-like formatting.

- \***bold**\* text is surrounded by asterisks (\*)
- \_*italicized*\_ text is surrounded by underscores (\_)
- [https://links.com](#) will be formatted as long as they are preceded by `http[s]://`.
